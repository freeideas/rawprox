* Initially, write @FOUNDATION.md then prompt @startup.md; read @README.md and @SPECIFICATION.md; they probably won't be right first try; consider updating @FOUNDATION.md and redo

* Whenever you change documentation, prompt @doc-consistency.md and @test-coverage.md; remember to read the reports and decide whether to follow the recommendations (don't blindly follow them)

* whenever tests or code has changed, prompt @test-fix-loop.md, then read the report it writes

* whenever a bug escapes detection of tests, write ./tmp/BUG_REPORT.md then prompt @bug-report.md then read the report.
