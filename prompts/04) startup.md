# Project Startup

Read `@README.md` and `@SPECIFICATION.md`, then create or review:

1. `./scripts/build.py` — Build automation
2. `./scripts/test.py` — Test execution
3. Source code files as required

## Goal

Run `build.py` iteratively until the code compiles successfully. Testing comes later.

## Issue Tracking

While working, append to `./reports/startup-report.txt` any problems discovered:
- Design flaws in specifications
- Documentation errors or ambiguities
- Unusual implementation difficulties
