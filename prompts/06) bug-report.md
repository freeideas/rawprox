# Bug Analysis and Test Gap Investigation

Read `@tmp/BUG_REPORT.md` describing a bug that escaped testing.

## Investigation Goals

**Do not fix the code yet.** Focus on understanding why the bug wasn't caught.

### Questions to Answer

1. **Root cause**: Can you identify the underlying cause in the code?
2. **Documentation gaps**: Do `FOUNDATION.md`, `README.md`, or `SPECIFICATION.md` have missing or ambiguous requirements that allowed this bug?
3. **Test gaps**: How can we modify `@scripts/test.py` or related test scripts to reproduce this bug?

## Deliverable

Write actionable recommendations to `./reports/bug-remedy_report.md` covering:
- Why the bug was missed
- What tests should be added
- Whether documentation needs clarification
