Read @README.md and @SPECIFICATION.md for background.

Please find every *.md document in this tree of files (but ignore the ./prompts directory and the ./reports directory), and verify that the source code is consistent with it.
Make any code changes needed for consistency.

Remember that we don't want any memory of previous implementations to show in the code. We must not waste our limited focus on historical knowledge.

You should first find all the .md files, then make a plan for which files to compare against which code, so you won't have to remember all the .md files at once.
