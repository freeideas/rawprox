Please read FOUNDATION.md, README.md and SPECIFICATION.md, and make sure they:

1) agree with each other
2) have very little overlap
3) SPECIFICATION.md is targeted at developers who have already read README.md
4) README.md is for everyone except developers
5) SPECIFICATION.md does not have source code which an experienced developer will already know how to write
6) all are concise and not overly verbose

An exception to the "very little overlap" rule is that FOUNDATIN.md should be the foundation which README.md and SPECIFICATION.md extend. So the foundation will be something like, "I want to create X", and README.md will give an overview of X, and SPECIFICATION will say exactly what X should be, with enough detail that an experienced engineer could write it correctly. But there should be very little overlap between README.md and SPECIFICATION.md.

Remember that we are not concerned with any previous designs nor implmentations. We must not waste our limited attention on the history of this project.

Compare these files to any other *.md files you can find in this tree of files, except for the ./prompts and ./reports directories.

Don't make any changes yet, but report your proposed changes to ./reports/doc-consistency_report.md
