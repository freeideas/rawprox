Please read @README.md and @SPECIFICATION.md and then write or review:

1) ./scripts/build.py
2) ./scripts/test.py
3) whatever source code is needed

Run build.py until the source code compiles; no need to test yet.

While you are working, append to ./reports/startup-report.txt any design flaws, documentation flaws, or any unusual difficulty you encounter.
