Please find every *.md document in this tree of files (but ignore the ./prompts directory and the ./reports directory), and verify that ./scripts/test.py is consistent with it.

Modify scripts/test.py and any other tests called by it to ensure every feature, rule, and measurable quality is reasonably covered by tests.
Obviously some qualities will be difficult to test, and we will not try to test those.

Finally write a report to ./reports/test-coverage_report.md explaining how each feature or rule or measurable quality is covered by tests.
Also in that report, mention what testing is gratuitous, i.e. tests that do not follow from the documentation.
