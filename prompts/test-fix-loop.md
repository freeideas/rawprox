Read @README.md and @SPECIFICATION.md then...

Run ./scripts/test.py ; if the test does not pass, edit code (including test.py code if needed) and re-test. Run (and possibly edit) the .py scripts as needed.

Whenever cause of failure is not clear, consider adding more tests that will make the point of failure clearer. In other words, if something goes wrong between A and Z, consider adding a test at N, so we have a better idea where the failure is occurring.

As you work, append lines to ./reports/test-fix-loop_report.txt whenever you find any inaccuracies or contradictions in the documentation, or any other nearly impossible situations.
