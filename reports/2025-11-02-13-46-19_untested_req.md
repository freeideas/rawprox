Create test for requirement:
  $REQ_ID: $REQ_BUILD_002

  Requirement text: The build process must compile as .NET Native AOT single-file with no dependencies.

## Response

Perfect. I've added a test for `$REQ_BUILD_002` that verifies the build configuration contains the necessary Native AOT settings. The test checks for:
1. `<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>` - The critical Native AOT compilation flag
2. `<PublishSingleFile>true</PublishSingleFile>` - Single-file compilation
3. `<SelfContained>true</SelfContained>` - No external dependencies
4. `<PublishTrimmed>true</PublishTrimmed>` - Trimmed runtime

## Summary

- **Test file:** `./tests/failing/test_simple_proxy_session.py`
- **Flow:** `reqs/simple-proxy-session.md`
- **Requirement added:** `$REQ_BUILD_002` - Native AOT Single-File Compilation
- **Test approach:** Architectural verification by reading the `.csproj` file and asserting the presence of required Native AOT compilation properties (`PublishAot`, `PublishSingleFile`, `SelfContained`, `PublishTrimmed`)

The test ensures the build configuration is set up for .NET Native AOT single-file compilation with no dependencies, as required by `$REQ_BUILD_002`.
