Create test for requirement:

## Response

Test updated. The test now verifies $REQ_FILE_004 by:
1. Recording the initial log file content after first run
2. Killing and restarting RawProx with the same log directory configuration
3. Verifying the original content is still present (not overwritten)
4. Verifying new content was appended after restart

**Test file:** `./tests/failing/test_file_logging_session.py`
**Flow:** `file-logging-session` (reqs/file-logging-session.md)
**Added coverage for:** $REQ_FILE_004 (Never Overwrite)
**Test approach:** Restart RawProx with same log directory and verify original content is preserved while new content is appended
