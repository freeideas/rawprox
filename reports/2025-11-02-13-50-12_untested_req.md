## Response

Perfect! The test has been successfully enhanced with explicit verification for $REQ_FILE_007.

## Summary

**Test file:** `./tests/failing/test_file_logging_session.py`

**Flow:** File Logging Session (reqs/file-logging-session.md)

**$REQ_FILE_007 coverage:** Added explicit assertion at line 188 that verifies:
- Custom strftime filename format patterns are supported via `--filename-format` option
- Test uses `test_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.ndjson` format
- Assertion validates the created log file matches the pattern `test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.ndjson`

**Test approach:**
1. Starts RawProx with `--filename-format 'test_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.ndjson'`
2. Waits for log file creation
3. Verifies the filename matches the expected strftime-expanded pattern using regex
4. Tagged with `# $REQ_FILE_007` for traceability

The test file already covered all requirements in the flow; I enhanced it to make the $REQ_FILE_007 verification more explicit and traceable.
