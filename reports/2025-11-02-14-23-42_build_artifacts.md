# Build Artifacts Analysis Report

## Documentation Specifications for ./release/

I reviewed all documentation files to understand what should be in the `./release/` directory:

### From README.md (lines 98-105)

The documentation explicitly states:

> **Build Artifacts**
>
> After building, the `./release/` directory must contain **only** the single executable:
> - `rawprox.exe` -- Single AOT-compiled binary (no .pdb, .dll, or config files)
>
> The build process should:
> 1. Compile as .NET Native AOT (single-file, no dependencies)
> 2. Place only `rawprox.exe` in `./release/`
> 3. Ensure no debug files (.pdb) or runtime files (.dll) are included

### From README.md (line 16)

> - **No dependencies** -- Single executable, runs anywhere

### From README.md (lines 91-95)

> **Runtime Requirements**
>
> RawProx runs without any external dependencies. It's a single executable (`rawprox.exe`) that can be run directly.
>
> The binary is AOT-compiled using .NET 8 or above.

**Documentation Summary:**
- The `./release/` directory should contain **exactly one file**: `rawprox.exe`
- No .pdb files (debug symbols)
- No .dll files (dynamic libraries)  
- No .deps.json or .runtimeconfig.json files (runtime configuration)
- Single executable with no dependencies

## Actual Build Output in ./release/

Running `ls -lah ./release/` shows:

```
total 8.4M
drwxr-xr-x 1 cfree 197121   0 Nov  2 14:20 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 cfree 197121   0 Nov  2 14:20 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 cfree 197121 13M Nov  2 14:20 rawprox.exe
```

**Actual artifacts:**
- `rawprox.exe` (13 MB) - single executable file
- No other files present

## Comparison and Verdict

✅ **Documentation expectation**: Single file `rawprox.exe` with no dependencies, no .pdb, no .dll files

✅ **Actual build output**: Single file `rawprox.exe` with no other files

The build artifacts **match the documentation perfectly**. The `./release/` directory contains exactly what is specified -- a single AOT-compiled executable with no dependencies, debug files, or runtime configuration files.

PASS
