# Build Artifacts Analysis Report

## 1. What Documentation Specifies for ./release/

The documentation is very clear about what should be in the `./release/` directory. From `README.md` lines 97-106:

> ## Build Artifacts
>
> After building, the `./release/` directory must contain **only** the single executable:
> - `rawprox.exe` -- Single AOT-compiled binary (no .pdb, .dll, or config files)
>
> The build process should:
> 1. Compile as .NET Native AOT (single-file, no dependencies)
> 2. Place only `rawprox.exe` in `./release/`
> 3. Ensure no debug files (.pdb) or runtime files (.dll) are included

Additionally, from `README.md` line 16 and line 93:
- **"No dependencies"** -- Single executable, runs anywhere
- **Runtime Requirements:** "RawProx runs without any external dependencies. It's a single executable (`rawprox.exe`) that can be run directly."

The documentation consistently emphasizes:
- Single executable only
- No .pdb files (debug symbols)
- No .dll files (runtime dependencies)
- No config files (.deps.json, .runtimeconfig.json)
- AOT-compiled, self-contained binary

## 2. What is Actually in ./release/

From the `ls -la ./release/` output:

```
total 2468
drwxr-xr-x 1 cfree 197121       0 Nov  2 20:12 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 cfree 197121       0 Nov  2 20:12 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 cfree 197121 3607040 Nov  2 19:58 rawprox.exe
```

The directory contains:
- `rawprox.exe` (3.6 MB)
- No other files

## 3. Match Assessment

**The build artifacts match the documentation perfectly.**

✅ Expected file present: `rawprox.exe`  
✅ No unexpected files: No .pdb, .dll, .deps.json, .runtimeconfig.json, or other files  
✅ File type matches: Single executable as specified  
✅ Dependencies match: No dependency files present (consistent with "no dependencies" claim)

The build process has correctly produced exactly what the documentation specifies: a single AOT-compiled executable with no additional files.

PASS
