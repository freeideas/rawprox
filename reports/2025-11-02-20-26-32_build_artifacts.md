# Build Artifacts Analysis Report

## 1. What Documentation Specifies for ./release/

After reviewing all documentation files, the specification for build artifacts is clear and explicit:

**From README.md (lines 98-106):**
> After building, the `./release/` directory must contain **only** the single executable:
> - `rawprox.exe` -- Single AOT-compiled binary (no .pdb, .dll, or config files)
>
> The build process should:
> 1. Compile as .NET Native AOT (single-file, no dependencies)
> 2. Place only `rawprox.exe` in `./release/`
> 3. Ensure no debug files (.pdb) or runtime files (.dll) are included

**From README.md (lines 91-94):**
> RawProx runs without any external dependencies. It's a single executable (`rawprox.exe`) that can be run directly.
>
> The binary is AOT-compiled using .NET 8 or above.

**From README.md (line 16):**
> - **No dependencies** -- Single executable, runs anywhere

The documentation consistently emphasizes:
- Single executable file (`rawprox.exe`)
- No dependencies
- No .pdb (debug) files
- No .dll files
- No runtime configuration files (.runtimeconfig.json)
- No dependency files (.deps.json)

## 2. What is Actually in ./release/

Current contents of `./release/`:
```
total 2.5M
-rwxr-xr-x 1 cfree 197121 3.5M Nov  2 20:21 rawprox.exe
```

The directory contains:
- ✅ `rawprox.exe` (3.5 MB, executable)
- ✅ No .pdb files
- ✅ No .dll files
- ✅ No .runtimeconfig.json
- ✅ No .deps.json
- ✅ No other files

## 3. Match Status

**The build artifacts PERFECTLY match the documentation specifications.**

The `./release/` directory contains exactly what the documentation requires:
- One single file: `rawprox.exe`
- No debug files
- No dependency files
- No runtime configuration files
- No additional artifacts

The build process has correctly produced a single, self-contained AOT-compiled executable as specified.

PASS
