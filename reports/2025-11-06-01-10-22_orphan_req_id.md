## Prompt

Please follow these instructions: @./the-system/prompts/REMOVE_ORPHAN_REQS.md

Orphan $REQ_IDs to remove:
  $REQ_SIMPLE_014B:
    - tests/failing/test_02_simple_proxy_session.py:316
    - tests/failing/test_02_simple_proxy_session.py:436
    - tests/failing/test_02_simple_proxy_session.py:449

---

## Response

Removed orphan requirement references from the simple proxy session test.

- `tests/failing/test_02_simple_proxy_session.py:316` and `:436` now use plain-language comments to explain the Unicode-escape check without the orphan tag.
- `tests/failing/test_02_simple_proxy_session.py:449` drops the trailing `$REQ_SIMPLE_014B` inline comment while keeping the assertion message intact.

Orphans removed: 3; files touched: 1; issues encountered: none.

Next step: 1. Run the relevant test suite to confirm everything still passes.
