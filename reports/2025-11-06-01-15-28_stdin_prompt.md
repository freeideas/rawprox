## Prompt

Follow instructions in @the-system/prompts/CODE_REVIEW_FOR_REQUIREMENT.md

Requirement: $REQ_SIMPLE_018 - Network forwarding never waits for disk writes. Network data forwarding is never slowed down by file write operations.

Also verify: $REQ_SIMPLE_019 - Log messages are buffered in memory until written to disk.

Check for:
- Memory buffer for log events
- Network forwarding operations do not directly call disk I/O
- Disk writes happen asynchronously on background thread/task
- LogEvent() returns immediately after queuing to memory
